There was a hole in the ground, and a hobbit lived in the hole. The hole was not dirty at all 
and not at all damp; worms were not swarming in it, slugs were not clinging to the walls, no -
it was dry and warm in the hole, it smelled nice, there was something to sit down and eat there -
in short, the hole belonged to a hobbit, and therefore, of course, it was cozy in in every way.
